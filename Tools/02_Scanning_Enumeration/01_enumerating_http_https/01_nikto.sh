# DESCRIPTION : 	Nikto is a web server assesment tool .It is defined to find various default and insecure files, program, configurations on any type of 
# web server.

# A) BASIC TESTING: 	port 80 is assumed if none is specified

nikto -h 192.168.0.56	#1

# to check on a different port
nikto -h 192.168.0.56 -p 443	#2

# ports and protocols can also be conveyed using a full url syntax
nikto -h http://192.168.0.56	#3 , similar to #1
nikto -h https://192.168.0.56   #4 , similar to #2


# B) MULTIPLE PORT TESTING:
nikto -h 192.168.0.56 -p 80,88,443	#5


# C) MULTIPLE HOST TESTING:	# instead of an ip address with -h option , pass a filename of all the hosts
nikto -h hostnames.txt   #6

# a host file may also be an nmap output in greppable format
nmap -T4 -p80 192.168.43/0 -oG - | nikto -h -   #7 , here "-" is used as filename for nmap output and nikto input
