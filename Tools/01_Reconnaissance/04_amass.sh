# Getting ASN associated with Tesla
amass intel -org "Tesla"
# now using the ASN we got from above command , getting some domains
amass intel -active -asn 394161

# passing amass intel techniques together recursively
amass intel -asn 394161 -whois -d tesla.com




# AMASS ENUM :			USED TO FIND MORE SUBDOMAINS

amass enum -d example.com
# passing asn along with above example results in more information
amass enum -asn 12345 -d example.com

# scaraping unpublished domains
amass enum -brute -src -d example.com

# getting more subdomains, get cidr from whois lookup and asn from command in line 17 of this file
amass enum -d example.com 1.2.3.0/24 -asn 12345


# AMASS TRACK : 		USED TO SEE SUBDOMAINS THAT HAVE APPEARED SINCE LAST SCAN ON A DOMAIN
